# Lab 4.2 loops 
# Author Linda Nikolajeva

# Programme that uses a while loop
# To print all the even numbers
# From 2 to 100

numTo = 100 # initializes a variable numTo with the value 100
# It represents the upper limit up to which even numbers will be printed
evenNum = 2 # initializes a variable evenNum with the value 2, which is the first even number in the sequence

while evenNum <= numTo: # starts a while loop
    # that will continue running as long as evenNum is less than or equal to numTo (100)
    print (evenNum) #  prints the current value of evenNum, displaying the even number on the screen
    evenNum += 2 #  increases evenNum by 2, ensuring that only even numbers are printed in each iteration
